Initially this shell was written using tsh but i've decided to redo my own instead to provide a custom limited shell.

If using the external library ipgetter you will need to pip install it..

However if you are on a vanilla linux server (like myself) the initial command you will need is

sudo apt-get install python-pip

then

pip install ipgetter
